# Simple Calculator Application
This applicaiton has been published to the Google Play Store and aims to make life easier for students who use mathematics in their everyday life.
The application allows for a number of different operations to be carried out. The list of features currently available include:

* **Quadratic Formula** - Used at GCSE to solve quadratic equations to find positive and negative values.
* **Young's Modulus** - Used to find tensile stress and strain of a material in A-Level physics.
* **Refractive Index** - Used with the angle of incidence and angle of refraction to find out the refractive angle of a light or other object.
* **Area or Circumference of a Circle and Volume of a Sphere** - Used in GCSE & A-Level mathematics.
* **Change in Gravitational Potential Energy** - Used in GCSE & A-level physics to find the change in energy *(gravitational potential)* of an object.
* **Wattage, Voltage or Amperage** - Used in GCSE & A-level physics to measure the amount of voltage over, power in, or current travelling through a circuit.
* **Volume of a Prism** - Used in GCSE & A-level mathematics to find out the volume of various prisms.
* **Momentum of an Object** - Used throughout GCSE & A-level physics to find out the momentum of an object using mass and velocity.
* **Velocity of a Wave** - Used throughout A-level physics to find out the velocity of a sound wave using the wavelength (lambda) and frequency (hertz).
* **Gradient Value** - Used throughout GCSE and A-level mathematics and physics to map the gradient of a given line using delta values for X and Y.
* **Periodic Time** - Used in GCSE and A-level physics to find out the periodic time of a wave using the frequency.
* **Efficiency** - Used in GCSE and A-level mathematics and physics to find out the efficiency of an action using input and output energy.
* **SUVAT Equations** - Used throughout many areas in A-level physics and other disciplines to work out velocity or another measurement of a given object.
* **Pythagoras Theorem** - Used in GCSE and A-level mathematics to work out hypotenuse, adjacent or opposite lengths of a right-angled triangle.

Features will continually be integrated throughout ongoing development, I will gladly accept any feedback on the application or suggestions for future work.
It is also important to note that this application is completely open-source and so if you wish to aid in development please do not hesitate to contact me.
